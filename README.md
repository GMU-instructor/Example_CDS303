Here's how you can set up a project repository for your class projects. Notebooks are titled starting with a number for the order in which they should be called. Each successive notebook calls the previous ones, with the team notebook being the final one.

Also, click on 'projects' above to see the example issue/task board. You could add all the tasks from the project schedule I gave you, assign names, set due dates, then edit status as things progress.
